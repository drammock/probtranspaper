\section{Conclusions}

Transcriptions from Mismatched Crowdsourcing are very noisy.
Nevertheless, ASR adapted using Probabilistic Transcriptions beats a
multilingual ASR.

Errors in mismatched crowdsourcing are reduced using phonotactic
language models, even if those must come from text.

EEG responses can be used to estimate confusion matrices. Entropy is
lowest in native language, second lowest in a similar language, and
highest in a dissimilar language.
