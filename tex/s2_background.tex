\section{Background}

Consider the problem of developing speech technology in a language
with few internet-connected speakers.  Suppose we require that, in
order to develop speech technology, it is necessary first to have (1)
some amount of recorded speech audio, and (2) some amount of text
written in the target language.  These two requirements can be met by
at least several hundred languages: speech audio can be recorded
during weekly minority-language broadcasts on a local radio station,
and text can be acquired from printed pamphlets and literacy primers.
Recorded speech is, however, not usually transcribed; and the
requirement of native language transcription is beyond the economic
capabilities of many minority-language communities.
