
\subsection{Mismatched Crowdsourcing}

Mismatched transcriptions were collected from crowd workers (Turkers)
on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)~\cite{MTurk} for all the data listed
in Table~\ref{tab:data}.  The 5-sec speech segments described above
were further split into 4 non-overlapping segments; shorter segments
made the listening task easier for the Turkers. The crowdsourcing task
was set up as described in~\cite{JHJ15b}. The Turkers were asked to
listen to speech segments in a language they were unfamiliar with and
write down English text (typically in the form of nonsense syllables)
closest to what they think they heard. Each speech segment was
transcribed by 10 distinct Turkers. More than 2500 Turkers
participated in these tasks, with roughly 30\% of them claiming to
know only English. (Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese were
some of the other languages listed by the Turkers.)
