\subsection{Misperception Transducer Trained Using EEG}
\label{ssec:eeg}

((INSERT A SHORT DISCUSSION OF EEG RESULTS?))

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the EEG-induced misperception transducer we looked at the transcription accuracies for the Dutch language when performed using 1) mismatched crowdsourcing 2) feature-based misperception transducer computed using uniform weighting, $\rho_U(\psi|\phi)$ 3) EEG-induced transducer combined with the feature-based transducer, $\rho_I(\psi|\phi)$. To Combine the two transducers, the value of the parameter $\alpha$ was tuned on a subset of the Dutch corpus consisting $30\%$ of the speech excerpts. Table~\ref{tbl:eegresults} shows phone error rates for the three conditions.
