In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the EEG-induced misperception transducer we looked at the transcription accuracies for the Dutch language when performed using 1) mismatched crowdsourcing 2) feature-based misperception transducer computed using uniform weighting, $\rho_U(\psi|\phi)$ 3) EEG-induced transducer combined with the feature-based transducer, $\rho_I(\psi|\phi)$. To Combine the two transducers, the value of the parameter $\alpha$ was optimized on a separate development set. As shown in Table~\ref{tbl:eegresults} phone error rates were respectively improved $1.5\%$ and $2.5\%$ relative to mismatched crowdsourcing respectively using the feature-based and combined misperception transducers.
