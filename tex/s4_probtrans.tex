\section{Algorithms that Induce a Probabilistic Transcription}

Three different experimental sources were tested for the creation of a
probabilistic transcription.  Self-training is now well-established in
the field of under-resourced ASR; we adopted the algorithm
of~\cite{vesely2013-semi}.  Mismatched crowdsourcing used original
annotations collected using the methods of~\cite{JHJ15b}.  EEG was not
used independently here, but rather, was used to learn a misperception
model applicable to the interpretation of mismatched crowdsourcing.
