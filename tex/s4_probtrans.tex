\section{Algorithms that Induce a Probabilistic Transcription}

Three different experimental sources were tested for the creation of a
PT.  Self-training is now well-established in the field of
under-resourced ASR; we adopted the algorithm of Vesely, Hannemann and
Burget~\cite{vesely2013-semi}.  Mismatched crowdsourcing used original
annotations collected using our own previously published
methods~\cite{JHJ15b}.  EEG was not used independently here, but
rather, was used to learn a misperception model applicable to the
interpretation of mismatched crowdsourcing.
