\section{Experimental Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

ASR was trained in four target languages, each using no native
transcriptions.  Unspoken texts and untranscribed audio were acquired
in each language (Sec.~\ref{sec:data}).  Texts from mismatched
crowdsourcing were decoded using a multilingual misperception G2P
(Sec.~\ref{sec:methodsmc}), or using a language-specific misperception
G2P estimated using EEG (Sec.~\ref{sec:methods_eeg}).  Baseline
multilingual systems were trained using native transcriptions from
several different languages not including the target language
(Section~\ref{sec:mlbaseline}).  Finally, parameters of the acoustic
model were adapted using PTs in the target language, derived from
either self-training or from mismatched transcriptions
(Sec.~\ref{sec:ptadapt}).
