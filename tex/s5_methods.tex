\section{Experimental Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

Our goal is to train a phone recognition system for a given target
language in which no native transcriptions are available. We assume
that we have access to unspoken texts and to untranscribed audio in
the target language, but not to transcribed audio
(Sec.~\ref{sec:data}).  Mismatched crowdsourcing was interpreted using
a multilingual misperception G2P (Sec.~\ref{sec:methodsmc}), or using
a language-specific misperception G2P estimated using EEG
(Sec.~\ref{sec:methods_eeg}).  Baseline multilingual systems are
trained using native transcriptions from several different languages
not including the target language (Section~\ref{sec:mlbaseline}).
Finally, parameters of the acoustic model are adapted using PTs in the
target language, derived from either self-training or from mismatched
transcriptions (Sec.~\ref{sec:ptadapt}).
