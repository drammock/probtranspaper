No. Speakers with Positive Speaker Word Error Rate (%) Differences = N(+) =  4 
No. Speakers with Negative Speaker Word Error Rate (%) Differences = N(-) =  0 
   No. Speakers with No Speaker Word Error Rate (%) Differences = N(0) =  0    


The NULL Hypothesis:

     The number of speakers for which the differences is positive
     equals the number of speakers for which the differences is
     negative.
			 P(N(+)) = P(N(-)) = 0.50

Alternate Hypothesis:

     The number of speakers for which the differences is positive 
     is NOT equal to the number of speakers for which the difference
     is negative.

Decision Analysis:

     Assumptions:
        A1: The distibution of positive and negative differences
            follows the binomial distribution for N fair coin tosses.

        A2: In order to resolve the complication caused by cases where the
            difference in Word Accuracy is zero, half of the cases will
            be assigned to N(+) and half to N(-).  In the event of an
            odd number of zero differences, N(-) will get one extra, this
            reduces the probability of there being a difference between
            the two systems.

     Rejection criterion:
        Reject the null hypothesis at the 95% confidence level based
        on the following critical values table.  N is the number of
        speakers being compared and N(-) is the number of negative
        differences.

          MIN(N(-),N(+))      P(MIN(N(-),N(+)) | N= 4)
          --------------      ------------------------
            0                 0.125
            1                 0.625
            2                 1.375

     Decision:
        There were N(-)=0 negative differences , the probability of
        it occuring is 0.125, therefore the null hypothesis is ACCEPTED
        There is no statistical difference between trn/gmm/gmm_SW_eval.trn and trn/gmmpt/gmmpt_SW_eval.trn
